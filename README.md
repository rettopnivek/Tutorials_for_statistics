This website provides a series of tutorials and FAQs for statistics, given helpful detail, examples, and reminders for the applied researchers. Examples will focus on psychology research and use (primarily) the freely available [statistical software R](https://www.r-project.org/) (for details on using R, see this website for tutorials and further links). Both Frequentist and Bayesian approaches will be covered (though note the author is biased toward the Bayesian approach). Examples will be geared towards quick implementation and practical tools, rather than an in-depth coverage on theory.

### Sections

* Foundations
* Simple comparisons
* Regression
* Generalized linear models
* P-values
* P-hacking/Researcher degrees of freedom/Replication
* Bayesian approach
* Hierarchical/Multi-level modeling
* Advanced techniques

### Additional resources

Below are some useful, more in-depth resources for learning statistics and statistical theory:
* For an accessible introduction to Bayesian approaches and modeling, see [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/) by Kruschke, or [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by McElreath.
* A mid-level textbook to consider is [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani, intended as an accessible textbook for those in the non-mathematical sciences.
* The more theory-intensive [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2009), for those wanting an in-depth and strong theoritical background with applicability to machine-learning methods.
